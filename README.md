Kaleidoscope Refactor
=====================

A rewrite of the [LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial](
http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html) mostly aimed at removing global
variables; making the code prettier, more extensible, and more maintainable; and
most importantly at learning LLVM by forcing myself to carefully read the
tutorial and understand the code.
